# AllForward
This repository contains code for the simulation of multilocus mito-nuclear introgression following a secondary contact, under a wide range of selective and demographic scenarios. Code on the master branch was used to run simulations for Bonnet, T., Leblois, R., Rousset, F. and Crochet, P.-A. (2017), A reassessment of explanations for discordant introgressions of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Evolution, 71: 2140-2158. https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13296.

This repository is going to hibernate while new developments are implemented in a new repository (with a better name): https://github.com/timotheenivalis/ForwardMint
